Here I attach the necessary steps and files to prepare an environment
similar to the one found in the laboratories.

Vagrant [1] is a utility that creates and configures a virtual machine (VM)
following a configuration file (similar to a cooking recipe).
The provided configuration files will download a
virtual machine (VM) ('Vagrantfile') and configure it with
all the tools needed at the laboratory ('bootstrap.sh').

0. Create a directory X where you want to work.

	yourmachine$ mkdir X


1. Copy the files to this directory X

	yourmachine$ cp Vagrantfile bootstrap.sh X/


2. By default this directory X will be shared with the VM at the
   directory '/vagrant' inside the VM. Therefore, it is a good
   place to put your ZeOS code (or anything that you want to share
   with the VM).

	yourmachine$ cp zeos.tar.gz  X/
	yourmachine$ tar zxf zeos.tar.gz  X/


3. Enter directory X

	yourmachine$ cd X/


4. Start vagrant. The first time will download, start and configure the VM,
...it will take some time...  after this configuration finishes,
following start ups will be quicker (as the download and configuration
phase will be already done).

	yourmachine$ vagrant up


5. Secure shell into the virtual machine

	yourmachine$ vagrant ssh
		(it will start a shell into the VM, "identical" to the labs)
	VM:~$


6. Inside the VM you can change to the /vagrant directory where you
will find your zeos code:

	VM:~$ cd /vagrant
	VM:~$ cd /vagrant
	VM:/vagrant$ cd zeos
	VM:/vagrant/zeos$
		(modify, compile, run, debug....)

From now on you can repeat the steps 3-6 until the end of the semester when
you would want to issue a 'vagrant destroy' ;)
